# THIS IS A TEST
# DO NOT CLONE BECAUSE THIS CODE WILL MOST LIKLEY NOT WORK

### What is this?

This is for people who want to see what I am working on. There will be bugs and errors because this is where I will be working on the bugs.

Currently I am working on version 1.4

The current bugs I am mainly working on are the following:

- dolphin_wizard.py making the path variable echo into conf.dolphin
- Poor code quality
- Weird bugs in the server_editor.py file
- typos littered in the code

Thank you for reading
